connectui
=========

Ui for using Sakis3gz under Linux. 

Simple UI written in Java.
It helps the user to connect to the network using a 3g-key or adapter.
The variuous apns can be configured within the application source code before compiling.
I'll add more in future, or maybe a method to define others apns from the ui.
